# Bethe-Approximation-of-Permanent-with-Factor-Graphs
This repository contains some MATLAB code, aiming to calculate the Bethe Approximation Permanent and explore the relationship between that and normal Permanent calculated in recursion.

## Content
Ensure all files are in the same directory. **computeNormalPermanent.m** and **computeBethePermanent.m** are the functions. The calculation logic can be refered.

To see the convergence of message on the full edge of factor graphs, run **PermBConvergence.m**.
To see the relationship between PermB and Perm, run **PermBdivPerm.m**.
